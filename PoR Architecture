Design and development: This stage involves the central bank designing and developing the CBDC, including its technical specifications, security features, and the underlying blockchain or distributed ledger technology.

Issuance: Once the CBDC is designed and developed, the central bank will issue it to the public. This can be done in several ways, such as through a mobile app, a digital wallet, or a physical card.

Distribution and circulation: The CBDC will be distributed to banks and other financial institutions, which will then distribute it to their customers. The CBDC will then circulate in the economy as a medium of exchange, just like physical cash.

Usage and acceptance: The success of a CBDC will depend on its usage and acceptance by the public. Merchants, businesses, and individuals will need to be willing to accept the CBDC as a form of payment, just like they would accept physical cash or other forms of digital payment.

Regulation and oversight: The central bank will need to regulate and oversee the use of the CBDC to ensure its stability, security, and compliance with laws and regulations.

Redemption and destruction: Like physical cash, the CBDC can be redeemed for its underlying value, typically the currency or assets it is backed by. When CBDC is redeemed, it will be taken out of circulation and destroyed to prevent it from being used again.
