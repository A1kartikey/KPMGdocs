In the past year, I excelled in a challenging Blockchain audit for a banking client, showcasing precision and contributing to our team's success. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in developing a Proof of Reserve for a cryptocurrency exchange platform, now ready for production deployment. My commitment to staying abreast of emerging technologies positions me well to make ongoing impactful contributions to our team.
