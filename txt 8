I. Cyber Due Diligence

This phase focuses on understanding the DeFi protocol's security posture and potential vulnerabilities.

1.  Background and Team Analysis:

Review whitepaper and documentation: Assess the protocol's functionality, design choices, and potential risks.
Team expertise: Evaluate the development team's experience in blockchain security and smart contract development.
Past security audits: Check if the protocol has undergone prior audits and how they addressed vulnerabilities.
2. Smart Contract Security Audit:

Code review: A thorough examination of the smart contract code for vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and access control issues.
Automated analysis: Utilize static analysis tools to identify common coding errors and potential exploits.
3. Infrastructure Security Assessment:

Server and network security: Evaluate the security of the underlying infrastructure supporting the DeFi protocol. This includes server hardening practices, network segmentation, and access controls.
Oracle security: Assess the security of any oracles used by the protocol to provide external data feeds. Ensure they are reliable and tamper-proof.
4. Incident Response Plan Review:

Incident identification and escalation: Evaluate the protocol's procedures for identifying, reporting, and responding to security incidents.
Communication plan: Assess if the protocol has a clear communication plan for notifying users in case of security breaches.
II. Security Audit

1. Scope Definition:

Clearly define the scope of the audit, including the specific smart contracts, infrastructure components, and functionalities to be assessed.
2. Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing:

Simulate real-world attacker scenarios to identify potential exploits and weaknesses in the protocol's code and infrastructure. This may involve penetration testing tools and manual testing techniques.
3. Risk Assessment and Reporting:

Identify and prioritize vulnerabilities: Classify vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact.
Remediation recommendations: Provide clear and actionable recommendations for fixing the identified vulnerabilities.
Security report: Prepare a comprehensive report documenting the audit methodology, findings, and recommendations.
Additional Considerations:

Regulatory compliance: Ensure the DeFi protocol adheres to relevant regulations and data privacy laws.
Third-party security: Evaluate the security practices of any third-party services used by the protocol.
Ongoing monitoring: Recommend ongoing security monitoring practices to identify and address new vulnerabilities.
