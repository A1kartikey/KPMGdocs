The client, Trinidad and Tobago, approached Company A for the opportunity to create a national ID based on blockchain due to our established presence in the region and our role as advisors to the government. The selection was likely influenced by our expertise in technology and blockchain solutions, coupled with our commitment to compliance with all local and national regulations. As a trusted partner with a track record of providing advisory services to the government, we were a natural choice for this significant project, and the engagement originated from the client recognizing our capabilities and experience in the relevant field.
