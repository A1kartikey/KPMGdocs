Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to follow up on my recent performance appraisal. I received the letter today and I'm happy to see my contributions have been recognized.

I noticed that the appraisal doesn't mention the special bonus we discussed for [ Briefly mention the reason for the bonus request, e.g., exceeding sales targets, completing a key project].  Could you please clarify if this is still under consideration?

I'm happy to discuss this further at your convenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
