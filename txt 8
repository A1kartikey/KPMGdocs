No, the client, Company A, involved in creating a national ID for Trinidad and Tobago based on blockchain, is not an investment fund or a similar entity where the consequences of trading virtual currencies would be reported out to and relied upon by fund investors or other owners of the entity. As a technology firm and advisor to the government in the region, our focus is on the development of a private blockchain for the national ID project, with no engagement in investment fund activities related to virtual currencies. Our operations strictly adhere to all local and national regulations, ensuring compliance in our initiatives.
