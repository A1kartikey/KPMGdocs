Absolutely! Here's a breakdown of the structure of a Java program following the Google Java Style Guide:

**1. Package Declaration (Optional):**

- Adhere to Google's recommended package naming conventions (typically using reverse domain name notation, e.g., `com.google.api.client`).

**2. Import Statements:**

- Follow Google's style for ordering imports:
    - Standard Java libraries (e.g., `java.util`)
    - Third-party libraries (alphabetically ordered)
    - Your own project's imports (grouped by package, then alphabetically within the group)
- Avoid wildcard imports (`import java.util.*`).

**3. Class Definition:**

- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `HttpClient`).
- Strive for short and descriptive class names.
- Consider using public inner classes only when the inner class is tightly coupled to the outer class.

**4. Access Modifiers:**

- Google Java Style Guide generally recommends using `private` for member variables and methods unless there's a specific reason for increased visibility.
- Public methods should have a clear justification for public access.

**5. Class Members:**

- **Variables:**
    - Use descriptive and lowercase_with_underscores variable names.
    - Declare them with appropriate data types and proper initialization (avoid uninitialized variables).
- **Methods:**
    - Use descriptive and lowercase_with_underscores method names.
    - Follow Google's recommendations for method parameter naming and method length (generally less than 100 lines).
    - Adhere to proper indentation (typically 2 spaces) and use clear formatting for method calls.

**6. Comments:**

- Use clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious sections.
- Google Java Style Guide discourages excessive commenting, as well-written code should be self-documenting to a large extent.

**7. Code Blocks:**

- Structure your code using control flow statements with proper indentation for readability.
- Avoid overly nested control flow for better maintainability.
- Follow Google's recommendations for formatting `if`, `else`, `for`, `while` statements (specific spacing and use of braces).

**8. Additional Considerations:**

- **Interfaces:** Follow Google's style guide for interface naming (typically start with `I` prefix) and method declarations within interfaces.
- **Inheritance:** Use inheritance judiciously, favoring composition when appropriate.
- **Error Handling:** Implement exception handling using `try-catch` blocks, adhering to Google's recommendations for specific exception types and handling strategies.
- **Packaging:** Use tools like JAR for deployment, following Google's guidelines for JAR structure and versioning (if applicable).

**Remember:**

- Refer to the official Google Java Style Guide for detailed recommendations on formatting, naming conventions, and best practices: [https://github.com/google/styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)
- This is a general overview, and the specific structure may vary depending on the complexity of your program.

By following these principles, you'll write Java programs that are not only well-structured but also adhere to Google's recommended coding standards, promoting code clarity, consistency, and maintainability within a larger codebase.
