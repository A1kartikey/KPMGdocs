Scaling the throughput of the Aries and Indy ledger combination during the verifiable credential (VC) issuance process is crucial to ensure that SSI solutions can handle high volumes of transactions efficiently. Aries, being the agent framework, works closely with Hyperledger Indy, a ledger specifically designed for decentralized identity. However, writing transactions into the Indy ledger (which can have limitations on transaction speed) during credential issuance may require optimization. Here are strategies to improve the throughput of such a system:

1. Minimize On-Ledger Transactions

One key approach to scale is to minimize the number of transactions written to the ledger. In the verifiable credential (VC) model, not every VC issuance needs to be written to the ledger. Instead:

DIDs and Credential Schemas are written to the ledger once.

The issuance of verifiable credentials (VCs) and their verification can occur off-ledger.



This approach significantly reduces the need to write transactions for every credential issuance, enhancing scalability.

How it works:

Issuer Writes Schema/Definition Once: When an issuer first issues a credential type, they write a credential schema and credential definition to the Indy ledger. These are reused for issuing multiple credentials.

Off-Ledger Issuance: After that, actual credential issuance occurs off-ledger. The verifiable credential can be exchanged between the issuer and the holder peer-to-peer (using Aries).

Proof Requests and ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs): Credential verifications (via Zero-Knowledge Proofs) do not need to write to the ledger either. Only the proofs of verifications are checked against the ledger for schema definitions, but the proof itself remains off-ledger.


2. Optimize Indy Network Parameters

Adjust Consensus Mechanism: Indy uses RBFT (Redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance) for consensus. To enhance throughput:

Tuning the consensus mechanism: Reducing the number of nodes needed to approve a transaction, if possible, can lead to faster transaction validation. While you have to maintain fault tolerance, tuning the network’s fault tolerance settings may help with performance.


Ledger Node Scaling: Increasing the number of validator nodes in the Indy ledger can help distribute the workload and improve the overall capacity to process more transactions. However, more nodes can also slow down consensus, so optimal balancing is needed.


3. Batching Transactions

Batch writes to the ledger instead of committing transactions one by one. By batching several transactions together before committing them to the ledger, you can improve throughput.

Batching reduces the overhead of ledger synchronization between nodes and the need to run consensus for every individual transaction. This technique is widely used in blockchain systems to improve scalability.


4. Use Revocation Lists Efficiently

One significant on-ledger transaction during VC issuance is the management of revocation lists. To scale:

Delta-based Updates: Instead of updating the revocation list for each individual credential revocation, you can use delta-based or accumulator updates. These methods only update the revocation state when necessary and in batches.

Off-ledger Revocation Checking: Some implementations maintain revocation lists off-ledger and check credentials through non-blockchain mechanisms to minimize ledger usage.



5. Aries Performance Optimization

Asynchronous Operations: Aries agents can be designed to process requests asynchronously, enabling faster interaction between agents and reducing bottlenecks during credential issuance.

Concurrency: Ensure that Aries agents can handle multiple concurrent credential issuance and verification processes by optimizing agent configuration for multi-threading and load balancing.


6. Layer 2 Solutions for Identity Ledger

Introduce Layer 2 scaling solutions for SSI credential issuance. Although Hyperledger Indy doesn’t natively support Layer 2, you can implement off-chain storage or verification processes, using the ledger only for essential elements (such as schema, credential definition, and revocation).


For example:

Use sidechains or state channels to conduct interactions between issuers, holders, and verifiers off-chain, recording only critical data to the main ledger, which reduces the load on the Indy network.


7. Caching Frequently Used Data

Caching frequently accessed data like schema and credential definitions can reduce the need to query the Indy ledger repeatedly. Implement Aries agents with caching mechanisms so that they fetch data from the cache first before querying the ledger.


8. Parallelize Credential Issuance

If your Aries agents or SSI solution supports it, parallelize the credential issuance process across multiple nodes or instances of the agent. This allows for better throughput by spreading the load over multiple systems instead of relying on a single point of issuance.


9. Use Indy’s Pluggable Consensus Features (Future Improvement)

In the future, Indy might allow the implementation of more efficient consensus mechanisms that can be swapped based on the use case. Keeping an eye on developments here could offer more advanced scaling techniques.


10. Aries Interoperability and Cross-Network Issuance

Aries agents are designed for interoperability, which means you can issue credentials over multiple ledgers if needed. In some cases, spreading credential issuance across different Indy networks can reduce load and scale the issuance process without relying on a single ledger.

Summary of Key Steps to Scale Aries and Indy Ledger During VC Issuance:

1. Minimize on-ledger writes: Only store critical components like schemas and definitions on the ledger, keeping issuance and verification off-ledger.


2. Batch transactions to reduce the overhead associated with ledger writes.


3. Optimize Indy ledger settings, including consensus mechanisms and node management, for faster transaction throughput.


4. Efficient use of revocation lists: Use batch or delta-based revocation management to reduce ledger transactions.


5. Enable caching and concurrency: Cache frequently used ledger data and optimize Aries agents for asynchronous, multi-threaded operations.


6. Consider Layer 2 or off-chain solutions for managing non-essential data to reduce ledger load.



By implementing these techniques, you can significantly improve the scalability of the Aries and Indy ledger combination during the verifiable credential issuance process.
