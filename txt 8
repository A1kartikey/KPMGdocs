The Importance of a Streamlined Branching Strategy
The audit identified areas for improvement in the project's branching strategy. The lack of code merge approval processes and the absence of a CI/CD pipeline tied to merges introduce unnecessary risk.  Without code review and approval, the potential for errors and regressions entering the codebase increases. Additionally, the absence of an automated CI/CD pipeline means missed opportunities to catch issues early. Ideally, each code merge should trigger an automated pipeline that builds the code, runs automated tests, and potentially even deploys to a staging environment.

Recommendation: Implementing a Secure and Automated Workflow
To streamline development, improve code quality, and reduce deployment risks, we recommend implementing a robust branching strategy with code merge approvals. This ensures changes are reviewed and approved before being integrated into the main codebase.  Furthermore, integrating a CI/CD pipeline with automated testing into the merge process will create a safety net. Each merge will trigger a build and test cycle, catching issues early and preventing regressions. This combination of code review, approval workflows, and automated testing fosters a more secure and efficient development process.
