The client, Trinidad and Tobago, initiated the opportunity by releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the creation of a national ID based on blockchain. Company A, with an established presence in the region and a role as an advisor to the government, was approached directly through the RFP process. The regional firm in that area expressed interest in collaborating with Company A and jointly submitted a proposal to fulfill the requirements outlined in the RFP. This collaboration likely stemmed from the client's recognition of Company A's expertise in technology and blockchain solutions, coupled with the regional firm's local presence and understanding of the specific needs of Trinidad and Tobago. The engagement began through the formal RFP process, reflecting the client's deliberate consideration of Company A for the project.
