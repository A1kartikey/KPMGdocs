The Impact of Missing Unit Tests
A critical finding from the audit was the complete absence of unit tests, particularly JUnit tests. Unit tests act as the foundation for code quality, verifying the functionality of individual code units in isolation.  Without them, deploying new features or fixing bugs becomes riskier. Introducing changes can unintentionally break existing functionality, leading to regressions in production. Additionally, debugging issues becomes more time-consuming without the ability to isolate the source of errors through unit tests.

Recommendation: Building Confidence with Unit Testing
To ensure smoother deployments, faster debugging, and overall code quality, we strongly recommend implementing a comprehensive unit testing strategy using JUnit or a similar framework.  Unit tests provide a safety net, catching errors early in the development cycle and preventing regressions during deployments.  Investing in unit testing upfront will significantly reduce the risk of production issues and contribute to a more stable and reliable application.
