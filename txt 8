ack of Error Handling: A Risky Business
The audit identified a critical issue: insufficient error handling, particularly in the front-end code. The absence of try-catch blocks and code specifically designed to manage failures, like file upload exceptions, creates a fragile user experience. Unhandled errors can cause unexpected crashes, confusing messages, or a complete halt in functionality. This not only frustrates users but also makes troubleshooting problems significantly more difficult.

Recommendation: Building Resilience with Error Handling
To enhance application stability and user experience, we strongly recommend implementing robust error handling mechanisms. This includes incorporating try-catch blocks to gracefully manage exceptions and writing specific code to address potential failure scenarios, like failed file uploads.  Providing informative error messages to users in case of issues will improve transparency and allow them to take corrective actions.  By building error handling into the front-end, we can create a more resilient and user-friendly application.
