When conducting a buy-side due diligence for WalletConnect from a cybersecurity, technology risk, and IT perspective, here’s a structured list of steps and areas of coverage to include in your deck. This checklist will help ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the platform’s technological risks and strengths.

1. Architecture & Infrastructure Review

System Architecture: Review the overall technical architecture and infrastructure, focusing on decentralization, server reliance (relay servers), and cloud providers.

Scalability: Assess the platform’s ability to scale, particularly in handling increased user activity, transactions, and integration with additional wallets and dApps.

Tech Stack & Dependencies: Evaluate the technology stack (languages, frameworks, databases) and any third-party libraries or services that WalletConnect depends on.


2. Cybersecurity & Data Protection

Encryption Standards: Verify the encryption protocols used for communication between wallets and dApps (e.g., symmetric encryption for messaging).

Private Key Management: Ensure that the platform doesn’t store private keys or compromise wallet security.

Secure Communication: Assess the security of communication channels between wallets and dApps, including potential vulnerabilities in QR code generation, deep linking, and session establishment.

Relay Server Security: Review the security of relay servers, ensuring no unauthorized access, data leaks, or unencrypted data transmission occurs.

Attack Surface Analysis: Identify potential attack vectors (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks, relay server vulnerabilities, or exploits within SDKs).

Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Scans: Verify if regular penetration testing, vulnerability scans, and code audits are conducted, and review the results of any recent tests.

Incident Response Plan: Assess if there is an established incident response plan for cyberattacks or breaches, including timely customer notifications and mitigation strategies.


3. Technology Risk Assessment

System Downtime & Failover Mechanisms: Evaluate how downtime or failure of the relay servers or infrastructure would impact the platform and if there are adequate failover or redundancy mechanisms.

Third-party Dependencies & Open-source Risks: Identify risks related to dependencies on third-party services, libraries, or contributors to open-source projects.

Blockchain Compatibility: Review the risks associated with supporting multiple blockchains and their associated risks (e.g., changing consensus mechanisms, forks, or updates in supported blockchains).

Future-proofing & Upgrades: Investigate the platform's roadmap for future updates and whether the infrastructure is built to support ongoing advancements (e.g., WalletConnect v2.0).

DevOps & Change Management Processes: Ensure the platform follows best practices for development, testing, and deployment, and has proper change management processes in place to minimize risk.


4. Compliance & Legal Risks

Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations: Evaluate whether WalletConnect adheres to global data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) since it may handle user metadata during sessions (though the platform doesn’t store private data).

KYC/AML Risks: Verify if there are any potential risks regarding Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, especially if any financial transactions are facilitated.

Intellectual Property: Assess the intellectual property and open-source licenses that WalletConnect uses to ensure there are no legal risks or restrictions on its use.


5. IT Governance & Management

Governance Framework: Review the IT governance framework to ensure that there are established policies for security, risk management, and compliance.

Roles & Responsibilities: Ensure clarity in the organization regarding IT leadership, cybersecurity roles, and their responsibilities, particularly for managing and mitigating risks.

Third-party Audits & Certifications: Verify if WalletConnect has undergone any third-party security audits (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) and review certifications relevant to cybersecurity and risk management.


6. Operational Security (OpSec)

Access Control & Identity Management: Investigate how access control is managed within the development environment, including role-based access control (RBAC) for developers and admins.

Monitoring & Logging: Review the monitoring capabilities and logging of events (e.g., session creation, transaction signing) to ensure traceability and early detection of anomalies.

Security Awareness & Training: Confirm whether the team undergoes regular cybersecurity training, including phishing simulations and incident drills.


7. Development & SDK Security

SDK Security: Review the security of the WalletConnect SDKs that are integrated into dApps, ensuring that developers are following best practices.

Version Control & Patch Management: Evaluate how well the platform manages updates and patches for the SDK and relay server codebases.

Open-source Contributions: Investigate the process for vetting contributions from the open-source community to ensure malicious code isn’t introduced into the codebase.


8. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

Disaster Recovery Plan: Review the platform’s disaster recovery plan (DRP) for how they plan to maintain or restore operations in the event of a major failure or data breach.

Business Continuity Plan: Evaluate the business continuity plan (BCP) to ensure that critical services and support for users can continue uninterrupted in case of incidents.


9. Third-party Integrations & API Risk

API Security: Assess the security of APIs used for connecting with wallets and dApps. This includes rate-limiting, authentication, and data protection measures.

Third-party Vendor Risk: Identify any risks related to third-party service providers or vendors that may have access to sensitive data or could introduce vulnerabilities.


10. User Experience & Security

Transaction Confirmation Flow: Ensure the user experience in confirming transactions is secure, intuitive, and reduces the likelihood of phishing or social engineering attacks.

Device Security: Investigate the security of devices used to scan QR codes or confirm transactions, especially in mobile wallets where devices could be compromised.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): Review if WalletConnect supports or recommends MFA for additional security during user interaction with wallets and dApps.


11. Performance & Reliability

Latency & Performance Benchmarks: Evaluate the platform’s performance in terms of latency, transaction processing times, and how it handles high transaction volumes.

Uptime & Reliability Metrics: Analyze metrics for uptime and reliability, reviewing any historical downtime events and the actions taken to address them.


12. Exit Strategy & Integration Risk

Integration Risks: Identify potential risks associated with integrating WalletConnect into existing infrastructure or platforms (e.g., compatibility issues, migration challenges).

Vendor Lock-in: Evaluate the risk of vendor lock-in and assess the possibility of replacing WalletConnect with alternative solutions without significant disruption.

Exit Strategy: Ensure that there is a clear exit strategy if the acquisition does not proceed as planned, including contract review and potential termination clauses.
