In response to the Odisha government's call for proposals on Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) utilizing Hyperledger Fabric as the foundational infrastructure, our submission outlines a comprehensive solution tailored to the state's dynamic requirements. Our BaaS platform is designed to provide on-demand deployment of Hyperledger networks through a user-friendly portal, allowing efficient configuration to meet specific needs. This initiative aligns with the government's vision by offering a flexible and scalable blockchain solution. With a focus on enhancing the issuance and verification processes, our proposal emphasizes the integration of various use cases, particularly centered around the diverse types of certificates issued by the government. This innovative approach aims to streamline administrative processes, ensuring transparency, security, and accessibility in Odisha's certification ecosystem.
