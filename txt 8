The project's absence of unit tests, particularly JUnit tests, is a significant concern. Unit tests act as a safety net for individual code components, ensuring they function as intended.  This lack can negatively impact deployments in several ways, including introducing regressions (unintended functionality changes) and hindering debugging efforts.  To improve code quality and maintainability, implementing a unit testing strategy is highly recommended.
