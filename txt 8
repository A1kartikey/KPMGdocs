The entity, Company A, involved in creating a national ID for Trinidad and Tobago based on blockchain, is not newly formed; it has been in operation for a significant period. The established history of Company A is a testament to its experience and capabilities. It is noteworthy that the client for Company A, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), has a longer operational history than the period associated with Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). This historical context reinforces the credibility and stability of both Company A and its client, aligning with a more traditional and proven approach in contrast to newer entities in the cryptocurrency space.
