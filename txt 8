**II. Project Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Procurement of e-ID System**

**A. Scope of Work:**

1. **System Requirements Definition:**
    * Conduct stakeholder consultations to define functional and technical requirements for the e-ID system.
    * Develop a detailed system architecture document outlining the DLT/Blockchain implementation, data infrastructure, security protocols, and user interface design.
2. **Vendor Selection:**
    * Prepare a Request for Proposal (RFP) outlining the system requirements and evaluation criteria.
    * Shortlist qualified vendors based on technical expertise, DLT/Blockchain experience, and track record in implementing similar projects.
    * Conduct vendor presentations and demonstrations to evaluate their proposed solutions.
3. **Contract Negotiation and Award:**
    * Negotiate contract terms with the selected vendor, including scope of work, timelines, pricing, and performance guarantees.
