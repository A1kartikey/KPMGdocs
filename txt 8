Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) with Hyperledger Aries and Indy
This approach leverages Hyperledger Aries APIs and Indy for SSI by enabling individuals to control their digital identities. Here's the breakdown:

Schema and Credential Definition:

Schema Creation: The issuer defines what information a credential will hold (e.g., name, date of birth). This schema acts as a blueprint.

Credential Definition: Based on the schema, the issuer creates a definition containing details about the schema and a unique Credential ID.

Ledger Storage:

Both the schema and credential definition are stored on the Hyperledger Indy ledger. This makes them publicly verifiable by anyone interacting with credentials issued under that schema.
Credential Issuance:

Offer & Request: The issuer sends a credential offer containing the definition ID to the holder.  The holder generates a request and sends it back.

Issuing the Credential: The issuer verifies the request and creates the credential using the defined attributes. This credential is then sent to the holder.

Credential Usage:

Storage: The holder securely stores the issued credential in their digital wallet.

Proof Generation: When needed, the holder can generate a proof containing specific attributes from the credential without revealing everything.

Verification: The verifier checks the proof against the publicly available schema and definition on the ledger to confirm its authenticity.

This SSI approach empowers individuals to manage their credentials and share only what's necessary, enhancing privacy and control over their digital identity.
