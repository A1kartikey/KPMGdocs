**Project Title: Implementation of Blockchain-Based e-ID System in Trinidad & Tobago and Establishment of Long-Term Software Development Agreement with UNDP Office of Procurement**

**Project Overview:**
The goal of this project is to procure and implement a robust e-Identification (e-ID) system for Trinidad & Tobago, leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and Blockchain. In addition, the project aims to establish a long-term agreement for software development services with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Office of Procurement.

**Project Tasks:**

1. **Needs Assessment and Requirement Definition:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment to understand the specific requirements and objectives of Trinidad & Tobago's e-ID system.
   - Define technical specifications, security standards, and functional requirements for the e-ID system.

2. **Market Research and Vendor Selection:**
   - Conduct thorough market research to identify potential vendors with expertise in DLT and Blockchain solutions.
   - Develop a Request for Proposal (RFP) outlining the project requirements and invite qualified vendors to submit proposals.
   - Evaluate vendor proposals based on technical capabilities, cost-effectiveness, and past performance.

3. **Procurement and Contracting:**
   - Finalize contract negotiations with the selected vendor for the procurement of the e-ID system.
   - Ensure compliance with relevant procurement regulations and standards.
   - Establish clear contractual terms, including project timelines, milestones, and deliverables.

4. **System Development and Integration:**
   - Oversee the development and implementation of the e-ID system based on DLT and Blockchain technologies.
   - Coordinate with the selected vendor to integrate the system with existing infrastructure and databases.
   - Conduct testing and quality assurance to ensure the system meets specified requirements.

5. **Training and Capacity Building:**
   - Develop and implement a training program for relevant stakeholders, including government officials and end-users.
   - Ensure that the training program covers system usage, maintenance, and security protocols.

6. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the e-ID system, including user manuals, technical documentation, and troubleshooting guides.
   - Facilitate knowledge transfer sessions to relevant personnel for sustainable system maintenance.

7. **Long-Term Software Development Agreement with UNDP:**
   - Initiate discussions with UNDP Office of Procurement for a long-term software development agreement.
   - Define the scope of services, expected deliverables, and terms of engagement.
   - Negotiate and finalize the agreement, ensuring alignment with project objectives.

8. **Project Monitoring and Evaluation:**
   - Establish a robust monitoring and evaluation framework to track project progress and performance.
   - Conduct regular reviews to ensure adherence to timelines, budget constraints, and quality standards.
   - Address any issues or challenges that may arise during the implementation phase.

**Expected Outputs:**

1. Fully implemented and operational e-ID system in Trinidad & Tobago based on DLT and Blockchain technologies.
2. Comprehensive documentation and training materials for the e-ID system.
3. Successful establishment of a long-term software development agreement with UNDP Office of Procurement.
4. Regular progress reports, including updates on milestones achieved, challenges faced, and resolutions implemented.
5. Trained and skilled personnel capable of maintaining and operating the e-ID system.
6. Smooth integration of the e-ID system with existing government infrastructure and databases.
7. Adherence to all relevant procurement regulations and standards.

**Note:** The detailed tasks and expected outputs may need further customization based on the specific needs and context of Trinidad & Tobago, and it is essential to engage stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.
