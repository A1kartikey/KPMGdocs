Subject: Alternative NDA Proposal for Collaboration

Dear [Partner's Name],

I trust this message finds you well. We appreciate your commitment to confidentiality and the sharing of the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) for our upcoming collaboration. After careful consideration, we regret to inform you that due to internal restrictions, we are unable to sign external NDAs.

However, to ensure the confidentiality of our shared information, our organization has a robust NDA in place. We propose that we proceed with the signing of our organization's NDA, which encompasses the necessary provisions for safeguarding sensitive information.

I understand this may deviate from our initial arrangement, and I assure you that our internal NDA upholds the same standards of confidentiality. If you have any concerns or specific requirements, please feel free to discuss them, and we will do our best to accommodate.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. We are eager to move forward with our collaboration and believe that this alternative approach will meet the necessary confidentiality standards.
