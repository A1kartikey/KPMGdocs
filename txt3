Here's a possible course outline for a Layer 2 Polygon (formerly Matic Network) blockchain course:

1. Introduction to Polygon:
- Overview of Polygon (formerly Matic Network) and its architecture
- Comparison of Polygon with other Layer 2 scaling solutions
- Introduction to the Polygon development environment and toolset

2. Polygon network setup and configuration:
- Overview of Polygon network components, including checkpoints, validators, and Plasma
- Step-by-step instructions for setting up a Polygon network, including configuration of network components and deployment of smart contracts
- Overview of Polygon network maintenance and troubleshooting

3. Polygon smart contract development:
- Overview of Polygon smart contract development, including Solidity and Vyper
- Introduction to the Polygon SDK and web3.js
- Overview of Polygon smart contract development best practices

4. Polygon network administration and security:
- Overview of Polygon network administration tasks, such as node configuration, identity management, and network monitoring
- Introduction to Polygon security features, such as checkpoints, validators, and Plasma
- Overview of best practices for securing Polygon networks

5. Polygon application development:
- Overview of Polygon application development, including the use of the Polygon SDK and web3.js
- Introduction to Polygon application development best practices
- Overview of Polygon integration with other blockchain platforms and enterprise systems

6. Polygon deployment and scaling:
- Overview of Polygon deployment options, including on-premises, cloud-based, and hybrid deployment models
- Introduction to Polygon scaling strategies and best practices
- Overview of Polygon network performance optimization techniques

In conclusion, a course on Polygon should provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the platform's architecture, development environment, and toolset. The course should cover the key components of a Polygon network, including checkpoints, validators, and Plasma, as well as best practices for network administration and security. The course should also cover smart contract development and application development on the Polygon platform, as well as deployment and scaling strategies.
