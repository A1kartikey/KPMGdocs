Here's a possible course outline for a risk and compliance in public blockchain course:

1. Introduction to public blockchain technology:
- Overview of public blockchain technology and its potential benefits and risks
- Overview of major public blockchain platforms, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum
- Overview of blockchain consensus mechanisms and security protocols

2. Risk management in public blockchain:
- Overview of risk management principles and best practices
- Identification of risks associated with public blockchain technology, such as cybersecurity threats, regulatory risks, and financial risks
- Development of risk management strategies and risk mitigation plans for public blockchain implementations

3. Compliance requirements for public blockchain:
- Overview of compliance requirements for public blockchain implementations, including anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, and data protection laws
- Overview of blockchain-specific compliance frameworks, such as the Travel Rule protocol and the FATF Guidance for Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers
- Development of compliance strategies and compliance monitoring plans for public blockchain implementations

4. Legal and regulatory considerations for public blockchain:
- Overview of legal and regulatory considerations for public blockchain implementations, including intellectual property laws, data protection laws, and consumer protection laws
- Overview of regulatory frameworks for public blockchain implementations, such as the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum and the Blockchain Association
- Development of legal and regulatory compliance strategies and risk management plans for public blockchain implementations

5. Case studies and practical examples:
- Review of real-world public blockchain implementations and their risk and compliance challenges
- Analysis of successful and unsuccessful public blockchain implementations and their risk and compliance strategies
- Development of risk and compliance strategies and risk mitigation plans for hypothetical public blockchain use cases

6. Future trends and developments in risk and compliance for public blockchain:
- Overview of emerging trends and developments in public blockchain technology and their impact on risk and compliance
- Discussion of potential future regulatory frameworks for public blockchain implementations
- Development of strategies for staying up-to-date with emerging risk and compliance issues in public blockchain implementations

In conclusion, a course on risk and compliance in public blockchain should cover the key risk and compliance issues associated with public blockchain technology and provide students with the tools and strategies they need to manage these risks and comply with relevant regulatory requirements. The course should also provide students with practical examples and case studies to help them apply the concepts they have learned to real-world scenarios.
