Here are possible deliverables for a course on Layer 2 Polygon (formerly Matic Network):

1. Installation and configuration of the Polygon development environment, including the Polygon SDK and web3.js, with sample smart contracts deployed and tested.

2. Implementation of a simple Polygon network, including the deployment of checkpoints, validators, and Plasma, with a set of smart contracts deployed and tested.

3. Development and deployment of a custom Polygon smart contract using Solidity or Vyper.

4. Design and implementation of an identity management system for a Polygon network, including user roles and permissions.

5. Implementation of a set of security best practices for a Polygon network, including the use of checkpoints, validators, and Plasma, and secure communication channels.

6. Design and implementation of a simple Polygon application, using the Polygon SDK and web3.js, with a set of smart contracts deployed and tested.

7. Deployment of a Polygon network on a cloud-based or on-premises infrastructure, with a set of smart contracts deployed and tested.

8. Development and implementation of a scaling strategy for a Polygon network, including load testing and performance optimization.

9. Presentation of a final project, such as a Polygon-based decentralized application (dApp), with a written report detailing the design, implementation, and testing of the solution.

Overall, the deliverables for a course on Layer 2 Polygon should demonstrate the student's understanding and ability to develop, deploy, and manage Polygon networks and applications. The deliverables should also showcase the student's ability to apply best practices for network administration, security, and performance optimization in a Layer 2 environment.
