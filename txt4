Here are possible key deliverables for a course on blockchain basics:

1. Understanding of the core principles of blockchain technology, including distributed ledgers, consensus algorithms, and cryptographic protocols.

2. Familiarity with different types of blockchain networks, including public, private, and hybrid blockchains, and their use cases.

3. Understanding of the key components of a blockchain network, including nodes, blocks, transactions, and smart contracts.

4. Hands-on experience with blockchain development tools and frameworks, such as Ethereum, Solidity, and Remix.

5. Understanding of the security risks and vulnerabilities of blockchain networks, including the 51% attack, double-spending, and smart contract security issues.

6. Familiarity with the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding blockchain technology, including key laws and regulations such as GDPR, AML/KYC, SEC rules, and the FATF guidelines.

7. Understanding of the current state and future potential of blockchain technology, including emerging use cases and applications.

8. Development and implementation of a simple blockchain project, including the design and implementation of a smart contract and deployment on a blockchain network.

9. Presentation of a final project, such as a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp), with a written report detailing the design, implementation, and testing of the solution.

Overall, the deliverables for a course on blockchain basics should demonstrate the student's understanding and ability to design, develop, and deploy blockchain-based solutions. The deliverables should also showcase the student's ability to apply best practices for network administration, security, and regulatory compliance in a blockchain environment.
