User Acceptance Testing (UAT) holds significant importance throughout the complete software development lifecycle. It ensures that the software meets user requirements and aligns with their needs. By identifying defects early on, UAT helps in timely resolution, minimizing disruptions in production. UAT enhances the user experience by involving end-users in the testing process, ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive software. It validates the software's compatibility with business processes, mitigates risks, and increases stakeholder confidence. UAT also aids in user training and change management, facilitating a smoother transition. Ultimately, UAT validates the software's integration, interoperability, and ensures its fitness for purpose.
